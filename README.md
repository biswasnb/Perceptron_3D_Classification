# Perceptron 3D Classification

## Overview
This repository implements the Perceptron Learning Algorithm to classify 3-dimensional points into two classes based on a given dataset. It also determines the number of linearly separable binary classification problems and analyzes the impact of varying learning rates and epochs on convergence and classification accuracy.

## Features
- **Perceptron Learning Algorithm**: Iteratively updates weights until convergence.
- **Linearly Separable Cases**: Determines the number of separable binary classifications from the dataset.
- **Convergence Analysis**: Evaluates performance by modifying learning rates and epochs.
